    <h1>EduClass Blog</h1>
    <article>
        This website serves as the blog for the EduClass Third Year Project, by Shane and Filip. 
        This is to document progress, issues and other related areas. 
        The below sections detail each week of development.

    <h2>Week 1</h2>

        <p>
            Week 1 was primarily focused around setting up the needed servers and database for our project.
            We felt that it would be wise to try and keep some working version, 
            regardless of features so in the event of any issues, we could fall back on a previous verion that still
            had some functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing setup for the application our attention focused on getting the basic CRUD operations for our basic models.
            Models like Student, Assignment, Teacher, Subject and Section were given these basic CRUD operations. 
            At this point we were still unsure if we would need more models, but we knew we would need these.

        </p>
        <p>
            One final item we did was to begin working on the concept of the UI. 
            We initially sketched out the UI on Excalidraw at this stage, and did some basic work on the colour scheme.
