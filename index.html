    <h1>EduClass Blog</h1>
    <article>
        This website serves as the blog for the EduClass Third Year Project, by Shane and Filip. 
        This is to document progress, issues and other related areas. 
        The below sections detail each week of development.
    </article>
    
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <article>
        <p>
            Week 1 was primarily focused around setting up the needed servers and database for our project.
            We felt that it would be wise to try and keep some working version, 
            regardless of features so in the event of any issues, we could fall back on a previous verion that still
            had some functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing setup for the application our attention focused on getting the basic CRUD operations for our basic models.
            Models like Student, Assignment, Teacher, Subject and Section were given these basic CRUD operations. 
            At this point we were still unsure if we would need more models, but we knew we would need these.

        </p>
        <p>
            One final item we did was to begin working on the concept of the UI. 
            We initially sketched out the UI on Excalidraw at this stage, and did some basic work on the colour scheme.
            One pre-existing system we took inspiration from was Google Classroom. The primary focus of this excercise was
            to explore ways of displaying a Classroom and its contents in a concise way, to ensure users would not find 
            the UI tedious to use.
        </p>
    </article>
    
    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
            During week 2, further effort was spent on finishing CRUD operations. THis was largely still trivial, but time consuming.
            As the amount of endpoints in the Express server was now rapidly increasing, it became apparent that keeping track of
            these endpoints was going to be difficult. Therefore, we decided that having Swagger documentation was gonig to be useful,
            at least for the majority of routes.

            SECOND THING WE DID IN WEEK 2 HERE
      </p>
    </article>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
          Week 3 was where we had a divergance in work we were doing. Shane was to work on file uploading, while Filip was to work on getting 
          direct messages working.
      </p>
      <p>
          Before starting on running files, it was first necessary to support uploading files to the server, and then saving them.
          This was to be done with Multer, an npm package. On first inspection, this module was easy to use and so would 
          be perfect for this task. However, upon setting Multer up, a number of problems began to emerge.
          Firstly, the form through which to upload the file had issues around its Headers. Multer requires some headers and attributes
          in a JavaScript formBody for it to save the incoming file. When Multer received the file, it would do nothing.
          This was naturally frustrating, and after an hour of testing it became apparent the problem was we were appending
          headers ourselves. This interfered with Multer, and instead the solution was to not append any headers at all.
          This would allow the Browser to append the headers itself.
      </p>
      <p>
          After this discovery, Multer would no longer throw any errors, instead it would just do nothing. This was far more frustrating, as now 
          we had no indication as to the problem. This was then compounded by the fact that the Multer documentatiohn stated that 
          TypeScript was in fact not fully supported, meaning that this problem could be simply unfixable. This was quite disheartening, 
          but regardless we peristed.
          At the end of the day, I simply moved the Multer middleware from the router it was being used in, to the application itself.
          It suddenly started working. This was truly nonsensical, but we now had working file uploading.
      </p>

          WRITE ABOUT MESSAGING HERE
      </p>
      <p> 
        This week can be summarised by a variety of vague and tedious bugs we needed to fix with our modules.
        As such, this week was not particularly impressive, yet we still now had two vitasl pieces of infrastructure in place.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
          Week 4 can be considered more fruitful than the previous week. Once again, Shane was responsible for now using the previously set up Multer middleware to now support file running.
          The first step to take is to prepare the file system for this. We would have a filesystem to hold uploaded files.
          This meant we needed to have a command to run every time we create one of our objects. 
          This was simple to implement, with only a single line of shell-script needed to do this. More time was spent on
          deciding how to structure the directories instead. Some consideration had to be made for security here, so that users could not see other peoples code. 
          This area around security was left to be decided on later, and instead the basic system was made the focus.
      </p>
      <p>
          The navigation system for the UI was then decided on fully here. We would have a Classroom, within it subjects were viewable to click
          as a shortcut, and then within them sections. The unique functionality behind each of these was left to later.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week was useful as a time to organise and plan ahead. We took care to ensure the features we were
        adding were not likely to cause problems further down to line.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
          Week 5 was focused on taking the previously set out groundwork and expanding on it. In terms of file running, this meant finally
          implementing file running. With the previous infrastructure in place, this would not be too difficult.
          A Docker container was needed to run the file and so all that was needed was to run a Docker container with a shell script,
          which would talke the arguments of the file location. This was not difficult, yet there were a number of features missing with this basic version.
          Arguments, taking the output, and displaying it to the user were still to be implemented. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our number of endpoints was larely now finished, and most of the Express code was now refactored.
        This meant that a number of endpoints had been moved out of the index file, and placed into separate routers.
        Annoying, we could not move the file uploading route, due to bug described in Week 3.
        This was however, the only real outlier.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <h2>Week 6</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        This week was focused on the User Interface. Our fovcus had been primarily on the backend system, 
        and so the user experience had been neglected. We would need to focus on the UI for a week in order to get it up to speed. This would also
        coincide with our desire to link these new backend system up to make a continuous system. Getting output from our file runner to the user
        was a priority within this overall goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had become more confident in the design we wanted and now with the routes defined for the user, it is easier to realise the design.
        The main pages for our system were now complete, albeit with some bugs. By this point we were feeling the pressure form our limited time and 
        so little consideration was put towards actually allowing the UI to be bug free. Instead we made static pages to test the new UI
        on and left the bug fixing until later. One factor that was slowing us down at this point was the disorganisation of our Svelte pages.
        As we now had a large amount of pages, it was becoming difficult to quality assure new features across all of these pages.
        We had only limited componentisation for items such as the navbar and tabs, and so we were relying too heavily on standard pages.
